# Drone Survey Management System

## Overview
The Drone Survey Management System is a scalable platform designed to help large corporations plan, manage, and monitor autonomous drone surveys across multiple facilities. This system facilitates mission planning, real-time tracking, fleet management, and reporting functionalities.

## Features
### ‚úÖ Mission Planning
- Define survey areas and flight paths
- Configure flight paths, altitudes, and waypoints
- Set data collection parameters (e.g., frequency, sensors)
- Schedule one-time or recurring missions

### ‚úÖ Fleet Management
- Display organization-wide drone inventory
- Show real-time status of drones (available, in-mission, charging)
- Display battery levels and other vital statistics

### ‚úÖ Mission Monitoring
- Real-time drone flight path visualization
- Mission progress tracking (% complete, estimated time remaining)
- Survey status updates (starting, in progress, completed, aborted)
- Mission control actions (pause, resume, abort)

### ‚úÖ Survey Reporting
- Comprehensive survey summaries
- Individual flight statistics (duration, distance, coverage)
- Organization-wide survey statistics (total surveys conducted, areas covered)

## Technology Stack
